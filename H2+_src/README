Based on the following paper
    :G. Hadinger, M. Aubert-Frecon, and G. Hadinger, J. Phys. B: At., Mol. Opt. Phys. 22, 697 (1989) 

Calculation of basis set (solution of the Schrodinger equation of H2+ ion)
and the corresponding Coulomb matrix (a matrix of 4 indices)


0. Pythonization of the fortran code BabHil.f90
    - enter: "f2py -c BabHil.f90 -m BabHil"



1. h2_iter.py 
    - input.py : (nlm) states to be calculated
    - which.py : internuclear distance (ex: 34=1.405a.u., 180=4.97a.u,...)
                 to be calculated


2. Coulomb_simps.py
    - precomputed files (the result of "h2_iter.py" needed) in H2+/ folder needed
    - input.py/which.py <- keep the same input parameters with h2_iter.py
